                <c>My name is Daniel Mangifridda</c>
                <p>2D Animator   /   Storyteler</p> 
                <d>There is truly nothing better in the world than a good story. Whether it’s a book you read on your porch during a cool summer evening, a small indie game that resonated with you at just the right moment, or a TV show you eagerly watched with friends every Friday night, each story holds a unique place in our hearts. My profound love for narratives that transcend various forms of media has fueled my passion as an artist and animator. Every story I have encountered and the lessons they imparted have shaped who I am today and influenced my work. I aspire to use my art to craft stories that resonate as deeply with others as the ones I cherish in my own life—stories that can uplift, provide an escape from worries, or simply bring a smile to someone’s face. One day, I hope my narratives will inspire others in the same way that the stories from my life have inspired me</d>
